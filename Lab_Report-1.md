## Step-1 Installing VSCode

Use the folloiwing link to go to the VSCode website [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the on screen instructions to download and install it on your computer.

Here you can see your Course sepcific username. Click on it and change your password by following the on screen instructions.

After you are done changing and password and noting down your username, open a terminal in VSCode.

Then use the *ssh* command given below but replace the **zz** with the the letters in your own username to connect to the server.

    $ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Then enter the password that you just changed.

Once logged in a screen like the one below will appear

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE Basement and commands run by you will run on that computer.

## Trying some Commands

Now you can try running some commands like **cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp** on your computer and the remote computer.

Below are some specific commands to try-

* cd ~
* cd
* ls -lat
* ls -a
* ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
* cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/
